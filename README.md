node-libutp
===
libutp bindings for node.js
API is similiar to the internal 'net' module.

Pausing a socket is not actually implemented. ICMP detection is not available.
(I cannot find a good way to implement them, if you know please tell me!)

The library may not suitable for using in production.
If you find any bugs, feel free to open an issue.
