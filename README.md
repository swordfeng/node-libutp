node-libutp
===
libutp bindings for node.js
API is similiar to the internal 'net' module.

socket#pause() and socket#resume() are not implemented.
(I cannot find a way to implement them, if you know please tell me!)

The library may not suitable for using in production.
If you find any bugs, feel free to open an issue.
